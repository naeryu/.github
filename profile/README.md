**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Not yet another event aggregator app. This is an app that personally recommend you events happening now and near you that you didn't even know existed. Unsure of what you want to do instantly, but you want to do something? We can figure it out for you. We don't propose endless filters to finally find something you're interested in. We make it more fun.
